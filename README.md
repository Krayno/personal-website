# A Responsive Personal Website
A responsive personal website made using pure HTML, CSS and Javascript.

## Details
Built using node.js with Visual Studio Code.

The Javascript was written in TypeScript. When building, it's processed by Babel to be ES5 compatabile then processed again by Webpack.

Feel free to use this website for your own personal use and modify it to your liking.

## How to develop with the project
Highly recommend developing using **node.js** so you can easily build the files using Babel and Webpack but it is possible to do so outside of node.js.

Follow these steps:
1. Extract .zip that you downloaded from this repository.
2. Open the project in Visual Studio Code.
3. Open a terminal in Visual Studio Code and run command ```npm run dev```
4. Open your preferred development server for live changes, I recommend using the Visual Studio Code Live Server Plugin.

## How to build the project
Once you've finished developing the project you can build the files to be used on your web server by running the following command: ```npm run build```.
